Regardless of the components, you build and who uses them, some things will remain the same for all users of the component.

How can we know this?

Well, consider the Expandable component we‚Äôve worked so hard on.

Regardless of the UI solution the user decides to go for, they‚Äôll always need an onClick handler for the ‚Äútoggle element‚Äù.

const { toggle, expanded } = useExpanded()
// user 1. 
<button onClick={toggle}>Click to view awesomeness...</button>
// user 2. 
<div onClick={toggle}> Burn the place down üî•</div>
// user 3. 
<img onClick={toggle} alt="first image in carousel"/> 
You get the point.

Regardless of the element they choose to render, every user still needs to handle the onClick callback.

If these users care about accessibility at all, they will do this:

1234567
const { toggle, expanded } = useExpanded()
// user 1. 
<button onClick={toggle} aria-expanded={expanded}>Click to view awesomeness...</button>
// user 2. 
<div onClick={toggle} aria-expanded={expanded}> Burn the place down üî•</div>
// user 3. 
<img onClick={toggle} aria-expanded={expanded} alt="first image in carousel"/> 
Now, that‚Äôs two props.

Depending on your use case, there could be more ‚Äúcommon props‚Äù associated with your reusable hook or component.

Is there a way we can prevent the users from writing these props every single time? Can we expose some API from within your reusable custom hook or component?

These are the questions that the props collection pattern answers with a resounding yes!

A props collection is a collection of ‚Äúcommon props‚Äù associated with a custom hook or component.
