How Control Props Work

Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Elements #
Consider a simple input field.

1
<input />
In React, a controlled input element will be defined like this:

1
<input value={someValue} onChange={someHandler} />
Hmm, thatâ€™s different.

A controlled input component has its value and onChange handler managed externally.

This is exactly what we aim for when implementing the control props pattern. We want the internally-managed state to be manageable from the outside via props!

Implementing in Expandable #
How it Works #
The implementation is quite simple, but we need to understand how it works before we delve into writing some code.

The default usage of the Expandable component is as shown below:

1234567
<Expandable>
   <Expandable.Header>
       {someHeader}
    </Expandable.Header>
    <Expandable.Icon />
    <Expandable.Body>{someContent}</Expandable.Body>
 </Expandable>
Within the Expandable component, the expanded value is internally managed and communicated to the children.

If we want to makeExpandable a controlled component, then we need to accept a prop which defines the expanded value externally.

For example:

1234567
<Expandable shouldExpand={someUserDefinedBooleanValue}>
   <Expandable.Header>
       {someHeader}
    </Expandable.Header>
    <Expandable.Icon />
    <Expandable.Body>{someContent}</Expandable.Body>
 </Expandable>
Internally, if the shouldExpand prop is passed, we will give up control of the state update to the user, i.e., let the expand value return whatever the user defines in the shouldExpand prop.

Actual Implementation #
Now, letâ€™s move on to the actual implementation.

First, we will check if the control prop shouldExpand exists. If it does, then the component is a controlled component, i.e., expanded managed externally.

12345678910
// Expandable.js
const Expandable = ({
  shouldExpand, // ðŸ‘ˆ take in the control prop
  ...otherProps
}) => {
  // see check ðŸ‘‡
  const isExpandControlled = shouldExpand !== undefined
  ...

}
Not everyone would pass in the control prop. Itâ€™s possible that a lot of users just go for the default use case of letting us handle the state internally. This is why we check to see if the control prop is defined.

Now, the isExpandControlled variable is going to define how we handle a couple of other things internally.

It all begins with the value that the Expandable component communicates to the child elements.

1234
// before 
 const value = useMemo(() => ({ expanded, toggle}), [
    expanded, toggle
  ])
Before, we passed along the expanded and toggle values from the internals of the Expandable component.

But we canâ€™t do this now.

Remember, if the component is controlled, we want expanded to return the shouldExpand prop passed in by the user.

We can extract this behavior into a getState variable defined below;

1234
// Expanded.js
...
const getState = isExpandControlled ? shouldExpand : expanded
...
where shouldExpand is the userâ€™s control prop and expanded is our internal state.

Be sure to remember that a controlled input element is passed the value prop and onChange prop. A controlled component receives both the state value and the function handler as well.

Before now, we had an internal toggle function.

12345
// before. See toggle below ðŸ‘‡ 
 const toggle = useCallback(
    () => setExpanded(prevExpanded => !prevExpanded),
    []
  )
Now, we can introduce a separate variable getToggle defined below:

1234
// Expandable.js
 ...
  const getToggle = isExpandControlled ? onExpand : toggle
...
If the component is controlled, we return the onExpand prop â€” a user defined callback. If not, we return our internal implementation, toggle.

With these done, hereâ€™s the value communicated to the child elements:

12345
...  
const value = useMemo(() => ({ expanded: getState, toggle: getToggle }), [
    getState,
    getToggle
  ])
Note how getState and getToggle are both used to get the desired expanded state and toggle function depending on whether the component is controlled or not.

Weâ€™re pretty much done implementing the control prop pattern here.

Thereâ€™s one more cleanup to be performed.

When the component wasnâ€™t controlled, the onExpand prop was a user-defined function invoked after every state change. Thatâ€™s not going to be relevant if the component is controlled. Why? The user handles the toggle function themselves when the component is controlled. They can choose to do anything in the callback with the already controlled state value too.

Based on the explanation above, we need to make sure the useEffect call doesnâ€™t run when the component is controlled.

1234567891011121314
// Expandable.js
... 
useEffect(
    () => {
		// run only when component is controlled. 
        // see !isExpandControlled  ðŸ‘‡
      if (!componentJustMounted && !isExpandControlled) {
        onExpand(expanded)
        componentJustMounted.current = false
      }

And that is it!

Weâ€™ve implemented the control props pattern.

I have yet to show you how it solves the userâ€™s problem and how to use it in the userâ€™s app. Weâ€™ll learn that next! But before that, letâ€™s take a quick quiz.
